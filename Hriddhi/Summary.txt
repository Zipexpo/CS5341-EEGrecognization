Summary

SVM algorithm has been applied using various constraints namely box constraint level, multiclass method, applying PCA, without applying PCA.

Results after training data: 
SVM without applying PCA, the best accuracy as 44.4%. 
SVM with applying PCA, the best accuracy as 22.5%. 

Results after testing: 
SVM without applying PCA, the best accuracy as 55.19%. 
SVM with applying PCA, the best accuracy as 19.31%. 

Hence, we can conclude that the highest accuracy of Linear SVM algorithm is 55.19%.
This accuracy obtained is not the best one and so this is not the best algorithm for EEG recognition.
