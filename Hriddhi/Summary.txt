Summary

SVM algorithm has been applied using various constraints namely box constraint level, multiclass method, applying PCA, without applying PCA.

After analysis, we get the following results: 
By applying SVM algorithm without applying PCA we get the best accuracy as 44.4%. 
By applying SVM algorithm witH applying PCA we get the best accuracy as 22.5%. 

Hence we can conclude that the best accuracy of SVM algorithm for this project is 44.4%.
